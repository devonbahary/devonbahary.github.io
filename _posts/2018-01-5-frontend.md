title: Confidence As A Web Developer
---

When I think about all there is to know, the entire project of taking on the profession of **web development** seems *daunting*. At times, it feels like I'm so beyond even knowing everything I don't know. The entire prospect of entering this new career can feel intimidating.

I'm someone who likes to operate in environments where the variables are clear and the path to execution is within known parameters. Maybe it's no surprise I took up an interest in coding, even years ago. I liked math; there's always one answer. Coding can be more vague than that, but you know when your program isn't executing right that it's doing exactly as you've instructed. The only flaw is the knowledge of what you're doing.

That's a good and a bad thing. It's like the pursuit of truth: it can be a struggle banging your head against the keyboard, just like it can be difficult in life to go about something when you have a misunderstanding about it. But it's worthwhile because you can come out the end with a greater understanding than you had before. And that's growth. The kind you wouldn't have had if you didn't enter the struggle.

Trying to get your code to work the way you intend can be work, but because you know that its your misunderstanding of something that's the problem, once you've reached that objective state, it's rewarding. Rewarding because your epiphany or breakthrough has been a growing experience. The jungle can be thick, but your machete gets sharper every step of the way to the lost temple of treasure.

I'm not intimidated by the challenge. All anyone has to do to overcome the fear of not being able to do something is look at past achievements. How many times can you say, "I don't think I'm going to be able to do this," and then do it before that voice in your head loses its credulity? As the mounting evidence of past accomplishments gathers behind you, it becomes harder to allow yourself to give in to that feeling of inadequacy. It's the basis of grounded confidence. Not out of ignorance to the task in front of you, but out of respect to the determination and willingness you've displayed again and again. If you haven't accomplished enough yet, get started. And if you can't overcome something, give yourself the chance by stubbornly rooting yourself in the task you want to achieve, allowing yourself to accept failure, and not leaving until you've accomplished that achievement.

The first time I felt something insurmountable was in high school. In Lacrosse, I had just enough of the fundamental stick skills to land myself a supporting spot on the Varsity team. Where I lacked was in what I dreaded to practice: the physical contact of driving against an opponent, inviting bruising stick checks and humiliation when the ball would pop out of my stick. I was able to get by on just the skills I was comfortable with until a graduating upper class left just a few of my friends and I as the most experienced returning players on the team. I felt then a responsibility beyond myself to become better, to dedicate myself to the team and to outgrow the comfortable habits I had formed.

I met up with my friends one weekend, we suited up, and I spent an afternoon running at their stick checks. Physical pain is a wonderful deterrent. But it would be temporary. And by the end of the day, I was moving the way my departed upperclassmen used to. My friends who had earlier had an easy time picking me apart suddenly weren't keeping pace with me.

I went on to become MVP of the team that year and my name was in the discussion for league MVP. It was a huge transformation for me and a pivotal growing point in my life. I think about Lacrosse every time I struggle with something.

So be comfortable with struggle. Be comfortable with adversity. Never be the one to tell yourself what you're incapable of. We all have innate talents and weaknesses, but if you care enough to struggle with something, you already have what you'll need to do it.
