title: Improving Through Adversity

> Not to take anything away from Stephen Curry, but I don't think he'd describe Basketball as **difficult**.

I'm sure what he's trying to achieve--consistently playing the game at the level that he does--is difficult.

I mean, there's a league of NBA players (handpicked, exceptional athletes and talents) that **would like** to do what Steph can in a pinch.

If you **asked** Steph how hard it is to make a three-pointer from deep, or dribble through the other team's defense, I'm sure he might **tell** you one thing or another.

Whatever he'd say, I think **deep down**, I'm sure he feels that all the training he's put into his skillset has led him to **instinctively** make the right decisions and execute with finesse.

But imagine that Steph decided tomorrow that he wanted to commit himself to **synchronized swimming**.

All the three pointers he's ever made **can't help him in the pool**.

**It's hard to do something you don't know how to do**.

Yet **learning new things**--and perhaps more importantly, **learning how to learn** new things--is **how we grow**.

> I think there's a difference between people who are **born of natural gifts** and people who had to **struggle** to get them.

**Struggling through adversity** to gain a skillset naturally and **subtly** develops **another**: the skillset to **take on new skillsets**.

Every obstacle you run into is an opportunity to **give up**. And each time you don't, you **train yourself** to muster energy to **overcome the trial**.

Sometimes obstacles require you to **reinvent yourself**.

Sometimes they ask you to **let go** of what you're **comfortable** with in order to **pick up** something you're **not**.

The kind of people who **struggle more than their peers** may not be the **best** in their respective field.

When they're **tested** though, I think they exhibit a **resilience** and a persistence that allows them to stand shoulder to shoulder with people **more qualified** than them.

Under pressure, it's important to **practice a dedication to the obstacle** until you overcome it. It then becomes a part of you, and you're a little bit **stronger**.

**[Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb)** calls this kind of behavior **[antifragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility)**, a concept he wrote a book about, __[Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile)__.

> *"Some things **benefit** from shocks; they **thrive and grow** when exposed to **volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors** and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, **there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile**. Let us call it antifragile. **Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness**. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the **antifragile gets better**."*

Whenever I **encounter frustration** during my web development endeavors, I keep the concept of **antifragility** in mind. At the beginning of my endeavors, I was eager to rely on my **proud sense** of programming ability to **get me through** my challenges.

When that **fails** though, and your **confidence comes into question**, you need to have **something more** to **overcome the adversity**.

> *I don't know how to do this **yet**. But **I will**. And then I'll have overcome it, like **all other things** that **once** stopped me in my tracks.*

It's an **easy mistake** to think that your ability **to do** or **not** to do something in a moment **sums up what you're capable of**.

It can feel like the **obstacle is a qualifier of your potential**, and it's shown you the end of the line.

But the most **difficult challenges**--the problems that stop us dead in our tracks--**aren't there** to set our **limits**.

Adversity is the opportunity to grow.

You might say, **[the obstacle is the way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Obstacle_Is_the_Way)**.
