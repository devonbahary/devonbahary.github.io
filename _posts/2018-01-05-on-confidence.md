title: On Confidence

Fellow web developers (and aspiring-for-anything readers), I want to talk about a couple ideas I keep in mind that get me through the ups and down of my journey into web development. With any luck, you can add these ideas into circulation while you go through adversity in whatever form it comes to you, too.

But first, please bare with me through a sports analogy.

Not to take anything away from Stephen Curry, but I don't think he'd describe Basketball as difficult.

I'm sure what he's trying to achieve--consistently playing the game at the level that he does--is difficult. It's not as though there isn't a league of NBA players, handpicked exceptional athletes, who have extraordinary talent and would like to do what Steph can in a pinch.

But I'm sure if you asked him how hard it is to make a three-pointer from deep or dribble through the other team's defense, he might tell you one thing or another, but I'm willing to bet that in all honesty it comes as second nature to him. And he's put in enough work to have earned that feat.

I bet after an incredible play, if you were to ask, "What was going through your head, Steph?" he might say something like, "I was put into a situation and I kind of just knew what I was going to do."

But imagine Steph deciding tomorrow that he wants to commit himself to synchronized swimming.

All the three pointers he's ever made can't help him in the pool.

It's hard to do something you don't know how to do.

It's the only way you build yourself, though.

What can be said of a person's character who was born of unusual talent, who passed every trial placed in front of him or her with ease, who rose to the top and never faced adversity?

Quite a specimen. And you wouldn't be wrong to admire his or her traits. But I think people who struggle through the achievement of their goals are constituted of something a little different.

I bet they're used to adversity. I bet they've faced obstacles, and they've actually been stopped (temporarily). I bet they had to reinvent themselves. I bet they had to lay down parts of what they thought they knew to rebuild anew on top of new ideas. I bet they had to let go of their reliance on a particular skillset to allow room for new skills.

These kinds of people may not be the best in their respective field, but I think when they are tested, they exhibit a resilience and a conviction that allows them to stand shoulder to shoulder with people more qualified than them.

[Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) calls these people **[antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility)**, a concept he wrote a book about, __[Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile)__.

Something that is fragile encounters stress and experiences weakening or failure as a result. [Nassim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) coined the term **antifragile** to describe systems (or people) that exhibit the opposite: i.e., things that actually grow stronger as a result of having been stressed.

Whenever I encounter frustration during my web development endeavors, I keep the concept of **antifragility** in mind. In the beginning, I relied on a proud sense of programming ability to charge me through the first challenges in my [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io) web development curriculum.

But after a time, I kept being introduced to new concepts. I had to learn new skills. What I had known how to do before was no longer what was going to get me over newer obstacles. And with each of these, pride diminishes. Maybe even a little fear sets in. Self-doubt.

That's when you need to recalibrate. It's an easy mistake to make to think that your ability to do or not to do something sums up what you're capable of. Inner adversity isn't a qualifier of your potential.

The most talented among us are powerful assets and competitors. But, perhaps, if they've never had to endure struggle and contention, they are fragile.

Adversity is the opportunity to grow. The most difficult challenges--the problems that stop us dead in our tracks--aren't there to say, "This is where your limit is and you will go no further."

Embrace humility, even when you've developed respectable talent, and in that humility allow yourself to admit your difficulty. "I don't know how to do this yet, but with time, persistence, and effort, I will solve this puzzle and it will become an asset to me in the future."
