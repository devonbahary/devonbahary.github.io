title: Next Steps
---

After over half a year in web development I know one thing for sure about this field: there's a **lot out there** to know.

I'm eager to keep on learning, so this post will be about where I think I want to **expand my skillset next** and a **project** I have in mind.

So I've got **Angular** under my belt, and I'm looking for the next steps to take as a front end web developer.

I'm hearing a lot of buzz around **React**, and my recent **meetup experience** in San Francisco the other weekend confirmed the enthusiasm I've been sensing around the library.

I like to have **projects** in mind to **apply** the abstract lessons I learn through web development, so I've brainstormed an idea for an app that could **actualize my React knowledge** as I acquire it.

> I like to build things that have utility.

**[Scholarly](scholarly.cc)** was an idea that came to me as I was trying to learn the impressive list of vocabulary words I was acquiring from my readings of **[Meditations by Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations)**.

**[Pomodoro](https://kind-lovelace-b7595b.netlify.com/)** was the manifestation of a time management practice I had been using throughout my studies with **[Bloc](bloc.io)**.

Next, I want to build a **nutrition app**.

## The Problem

As I recommit myself to the gym this year, I'm trying to gain lean muscle mass through a **structured diet**.

I'm not just counting calories, I'm tracking my **macronutrient ratios**.

For those of you who aren't savvy to nutritional science lingo, **macronutrient ratios** are the **ratios of calories** from **proteins** (4cal/g), **carbohydrates** (4cal/g), and **fats** (9cal/g) in relation to the **total calories** consumed in a diet, and these can have an **impact on your physique**.

> TLDR; **the proportion of your total calories you get from each macronutrient**.

A little research online and I've found that applications like **[MyFitnessPal](myfitnesspal.com)** **already exist** that offer services that will **count your calories and calculate your macronutrient ratios**.

**Absent** the use of such an application in my own life, I find myself doing **laborious manual calculations** on a **near-daily basis** on the back of mailing envelopes.

> Clearly an app would **simplify** this part of my life.

Call me stubborn, but I kind of want to **make my own** for the sake of practice and, well, **fun**.

## Macrotrac

I want to call this application **Macrotrac**. And I want it to have a few features:
* **user personalized** list of **food items**, **meals**, + **calorie / macronutrient ratio goals**
* connection to a **nutrition facts API** to **look up foods** and **import their macronutrient data**
* for any given day of food/meal entries, **food/meal recommendations** to **meet the calorie/macronutrient goals** for that day

> For any given day of variable eating, I could punch in what I had had to eat and **watch my calories and macronutrient ratios adjust accordingly**.

**Based on where my numbers were at by that time in the day**, the app would **recommend food suggestions** from my personalized list of foods that would **help me meet my calorie and macronutrient goals**.

This could be especially **useful** for when I eat something **outside** of my regular day-to-day diet.

I'd just **enter the outlier meal** and use the app to **course correct** and **meet my dietary goals** by the end of the day.

Well, I guess it's time to learn **React**! Check in with you after!


**Thanks for reading!**
